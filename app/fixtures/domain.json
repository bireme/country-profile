        "description": "Assessing health and pharmaceutical systems require background information on the size of the population, its demographics and economics, the pharmaceutical market size and the expenditure on health and pharmaceuticals. These key data are parameters that define the requirements that a system has to meet in terms of population coverage and availability of resources. \r\nThe percentage of pharmaceutical expenditure out of total health expenditure provides a useful indication on the relative investment in pharmaceuticals compared to other components. The variation on per capita spending on pharmaceuticals between countries is due to differences in the share of generic medicines, prices and consumption pattern among other factors. Benchmarking pharmaceutical expenditure per capita can help identifying inefficiencies in spending. Very low pharmaceutical expenditure per capita can indicate a gap in pharmaceutical service delivery and result in higher morbidity and mortality."

Pharmacy workforce comprises professionals charged with the final custody of medicines, before they are dispensed to patients, as well as ensuring the proper use and administration of medicines. They also be active in the regulation, manufacturing and procurement of medicines.\r\nCurrently, there is no recommendation of the number of pharmacists or pharmacy technicians per capita. However, very low numbers of trained human resources per capita in the pharmaceutical sector can indicate gaps in the delivery capacity of the system."

A national pharmaceutical policy is the explicit commitment of the government towards different policy objectives related to pharmaceuticals. It provides a guidance for action for all actors involved in the pharmaceutical sector. An implementation plan for the policy defines the responsibilities, measurable goals and timeframes of each actor and those overseeing the implementation. The implementation plan should also include the plan for reporting and independent assessment of the implementation progress. \r\nThe use of generic medicines and biosimilars is an important opportunity to increase the efficiency of the pharmaceutical sector spending. Policies to promote the use of generics are a corner stone to guide the government and other institutions to implement generic medicines strategies."

However, despite the great scientific developments and the advances that can be seen in some countries, the capacities for transplants in the different health systems of the Region of the Americas are heterogeneous.\r\nTherefore, having basic information about these transplant therapies allows us to propose a baseline that allows the monitoring of the strategy and plan of action on donation and equitable access to the transplantation of organs, tissues and cells 2019 - 2030 recently. promoted by PAHO, also to know and follow the behavior of equitable and quality access to transplants of organs, tissues and cells in the countries."

Additionally, inappropriate use of medicines wastes resources. Inappropriate use of medicines include: overuse (using medicines that are unnecessary), underuse (the absence of medicines when they are effective), the wrong use (medicines are not in line with best clinical evidence or wasting resources).  \r\nManagement tools to promote appropriate use of medicines are formularies or essential medicines lists, standard treatment guidelines and health technology assessments, among others. The development of these tools needs to follow a defined process that is publically available and that manages conflicts for interest if present. \r\nAdvertisement of medicines can provide distorted information about medicines that can result in harmful use of medicines. Surveillance of advertisement by regulatory bodies is relevant to prevent harm."

        "description": "Many medicines are considered essential goods which means that their prices are less influenced by demand. Measuring medicines prices can be challenging but is important to understand affordability which is a key dimension of access. Governments can influence markets that set prices through control of markups or eliminating tariffs and taxes. Governments are often buyers of large quantities of medicines which means that they can effectively negotiate prices and share information with other national or international buyers to increase their power. \r\nHealth technology assessments (HTAs) play an important part in the selection of medicines for reimbursement. An HTA consists of a systematic evaluation of the properties, effects, and/or impacts of medicines, devices and other technologies for health. Many countries in the Americas have developed institutional capacity to carry out HTAs to support the selection of technologies for their health systems. However, much needs to be done to improve quality and efficiencies in technology selection for health systems. Country collaborations in this area are vital to reduce costs of conducting HTA. \r\nTreatment coverage is one of the most relevant outcome measures to assess a functioning pharmaceutical system. It is a core indicator of many vertical disease programs such as HIV and TB. Since non-communicable diseases are the top cause of mortality worldwide assessing treatment coverage for common diseases such as hypertension and diabetes is critical in addition to HIV and TB."
